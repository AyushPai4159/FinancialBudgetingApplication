Analysis on spending percentage:

Based on the categorization, it appears that most of the transactions are related to online banking payments and paychecks. The two food items account for only a small portion of the total transactions.

Spending percentages:

* Food: 0.5% (2/400)
* Entertainment: 0.25% (1/400)
* Work: 2.5% (4/160, considering multiple instances of the same employee)
* Miscellaneous: 7.5% (30/400)

Note that these percentages are approximate and based on a manual count of transactions. They may not reflect the actual spending habits or trends.
